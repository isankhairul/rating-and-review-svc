# go-klikdokter-boilerplate

This is boilerplate for klikdokter microservice, it's use go-kit as our base library
The example to use this boilerplate please see this code
[Klikdokter Boilerplate Example](https://gitlab.com/medkomtek/scratchpad/go-kit-boilerplate)

## How to run

- Run consul agent (e.g consul agent -dev)
- In a root folder type `go run main.go`
- Swagger in /docs
- Run unit test in root folder : `go test -v ./...`
  
## Directory Structure

In go naming convention, package/directory names are not plural. This is surprising to programmers who came from other languages and are retaining an old habit of pluralizing names. Don't name a package `httputils`, but `httputil`.

```tree

### `/go-klikdokter-boilerplate`

This is your main project directory, you can change `go-klikdokter-boilerplate` with any project name you have.
When you change this directory, dont forget to rename it in `go.mod` file,
`module go-klikdokter-boilerplate` --> change this module name with your name,after you change this module name,
don't forget to replace the existing module name with a new module name when importing the package,
`import "go-klikdokter-boilerplate/pkg/logger"` --> replace `go-klikdokter-boilerplate` with your new name.

### `/app`

This is your application directory, put your model, database interaction, business rules, and presentation response in this directory.
In this directory, we have separate directories, each of which represents the layered architecture.

- `/api`
This is your API, middleware JSON schema files, protocol definition files reside.
In this directory, we must have 2 required directory as of go-kit architecture
  - `/endpoint` An endpoint is like an action/handler on a controller; it‚Äôs where safety and antifragile logic lives. If you implement two transports (HTTP and gRPC), you might have two methods of sending requests to the same endpoint.
  - `/transport` The transport layer is bound to concrete transports like HTTP or gRPC. If you want to have HTTP and gRPC protocol for the same endpoint, you don't need to create new endpoint, but you only have create a new transport protocol.
  - `/initialization` Use this file for your initialization for transport, service, routing and database. Please don't make changes on main.go file
- `/model` A model in Go is a set of data structures, instead, we separate pure database table models and custom models.
  - `/base` This directory is where you put your base models, for example, if you have a standard fields that will be used on many tables you can add a base model and you can use it in your models, this concept is like an inheritance.
  - `/entity` This is where your database table models reside.
  - `/request` This is where your request models reside, you can also add a validation.
  - `/response` Sometimes we need to present data that has custom fields or not the same as the database table, this is where your view models reside. For our HTTP response please use function `SetResponse`
- `/registry` This is where you registering your service, so we can use it.
- `/repository` This layer where you put your query or interaction with the database.
- `/service` This is where you put your business rules in action, It encapsulates and implements all of the use cases of the system,one `service` file can use many repositories.
  
### `/docker`

This is where your docker files & script that use on docker reside.

### `/helper`

If you need to create some function that can be used on the entire project, you can put your code here.
This helper function is bonded to your application.

### `/pkg`

Library code that's ok to use by external applications. Other projects can import these libraries expecting them to work.
So make sure to put the library code here is not bonded to your application.
